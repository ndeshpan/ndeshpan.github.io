If you have ever painted your house and been forced to sift through a harrowing supply of thick, wieldy color decks, you understand how difficult it is to choose cohesive colors.

Color shapes our first impressions of an environment, and can either attract or violently repel our brain.

Hospitals paint their nurseries with bright, jubilant hues like yellow or pastel blue to embody vitality. Scary films heavily rely on darker sets and costuming to portray a dingy, derelict atmosphere. Though we aren’t always conscious of the effects of properly picked colors, the right color scheme can transform a product and increase viewer engagement.

When creating technological applications, creating a solid UI with vibrant, attractive colors is extremely important. Color spaces and color theory go a long way for web design!

On illuminated screens or surfaces like a computer monitor, color is constructed according to the additive primary model. This means that any combination of red, green, and blue produce the wondrous span of colors we can see on a screen, ranging from raging scarlet to champagne and everything in between.

This RGB model is very similar to the HSL, or HSV model, which stands for hue, saturation, and lumninosity/value. Hue is pure color, saturation is how dull/bright something is, and value/lumninosity is how light/dark something is. By adjusting these three values, you can also produce any color. While the RBG model is based on a color space graph, the HSL/HSV model is based on a cylindrical shape and thus easier to view.

For computer graphics, we rely on the RGB model when selecting color. So how do you know which colors to choose when creating a schema? There are a few general principles that help you pick appealing colors. When creating color schemes, follow the monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triad, or tetrad relationships to establish a beautiful palette. These principles help you choose tandem colors that support and powerfully contrast each other to make a rich graphic. These principles are centered around the basic color wheel, and–in a nutshell–help you choose colors that are either far apart from each other, or close to each other. Choosing colors that are as far apart as possible can create beautiful contrast, while selecting derivative, adjacdent colors creates unity.

In addition to following on of the above color schemes, keep these two principles in mind: 1. Regardless of which color scheme you choose, select one bright, dominant color, and have others be slightly muted in comparison. This helps avoid unnecessary tension and vibration in your scheme. 2. Keep shadowns neutral when using bright colors. Stick with grey, black, or white so that your creation looks more balanced.

For this website, I plan on using a triad color scheme. This means that the three colors I select will be equally spaced around the color wheel so that my chosen hues are balanced and calming. I plan on using a violet - orange - green theme to harmoniously unify different pages on my site, and add a bit of pop. I’ll be updating the website soon with these colors, so keep an eye out!
