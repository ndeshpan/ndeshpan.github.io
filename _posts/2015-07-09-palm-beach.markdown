blog_excerpt: Palm Beach was beautiful, breezy, and had a great beachtown vibe. After realizing how close Miami was to our location, we also planned a spontaneous trip to Miami and got to see this amazing bay-side cultural landmark!

Although we initially planned to solely visit Palm Beach for the entirety of our trip, the beckoning signs towards Miami immediately caught our attention, and before we knew it we had planned a spontaneous one-hour trip to the southern city! It was about a one-hour drive along I-95 south--once we approached the city, we were rewarded with beautiful views of the city's bays and harbors. Miami is really interesting because it is split up by various water bodies! As a result, skyscraper buildings along the coastline get beautiful views of the cerulean-colored bays and the city's robust maritime life.
