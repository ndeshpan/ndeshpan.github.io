Hello, and welcome to my travel blog! My name is Nikita, and I love to explore different cultures, countries, and cuisines. I document my adventures on this blog. I hope you enjoy reading about my experiences! 

I also can't get enough of science, and love writing about pressing issues that dazzle my mind. Check my writing out <a href="http://www.thehoya.com/author/nikita-deshpande/" style="text-decoration:none">here</a>!
